# fish_classification_with_ANN

This project aims to classify different fish species using a deep learning model. The project uses a large-scale fish dataset downloaded from Kaggle and is implemented with an artificial neural network model built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Project Details

- **Dataset**: A large-scale fish dataset from Kaggle.
- **Model**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Techniques**: Deep learning techniques for image classification.
- **Goal**: To accurately classify fish species based on images.

This project uses deep learning techniques to solve the problem of fish species classification. Users can perform classification operations using a trained model to correctly identify fish species in the dataset.
